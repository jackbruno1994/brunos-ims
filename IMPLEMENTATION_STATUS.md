## What This Means for Future Issues

### ⚠️ Before Creating New Issues
Please check this document first. If your requested functionality is listed as "FULLY IMPLEMENTED", consider:

1. **Review PR #62** - The functionality may already exist
2. **Check the current main branch** - Ensure you're not working with outdated code
3. **Test the existing implementation** - Use the setup script to evaluate current features
4. **Request documentation updates** - If functionality exists but isn't well documented

### ✅ Legitimate New Issue Categories
- **Frontend components** that use the existing backend infrastructure
- **Business logic enhancements** that build on the existing foundation
- **Performance optimizations** for the implemented systems
- **Additional monitoring and alerting** beyond basic health checks
- **Integration with external services** (payment, notification, etc.)
- **Advanced reporting features** using the existing data models

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Run the setup script**: `./setup-dev.sh`
3. **Start development servers**: 
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
   - Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
4. **Access the API**: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`
5. **Login with default credentials**: admin@brunos-restaurant.com / password123
