# Bruno's IMS - Copilot Configuration Implementation

## Overview
This implementation establishes a comprehensive GitHub Copilot configuration with industry best practices for Bruno's Integrated Management System (IMS), a full-stack restaurant management platform.

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

### 1. Project Structure (Best Practice Configuration)
✅ **Standardized Node.js/JavaScript project structure**
- Backend: `backend/src/{controllers,services,middleware,models,types,utils}`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/{components,pages,hooks,utils,services,types,tests}`
- Shared: `docs/{api,code}`, `scripts/`, `configs/`

✅ **Modular architecture patterns**
- Backend: Clean Architecture (controllers → services → repositories → entities)
- Frontend: Feature-based Architecture with shared components
- Path mapping configured for both backend and frontend

### 2. Development Standards (Industry Best Practices)
✅ **ESLint with Airbnb style guide**
- Configured for both TypeScript backend and React frontend
- TypeScript-specific rules for type safety
- Import ordering and cycle detection
- JSDoc documentation requirements

✅ **Prettier for code formatting**
- Consistent formatting across all file types
- 100-character line length
- Single quotes, trailing commas (ES5)
- Automatic formatting on save

✅ **Jest for testing with coverage requirements**
- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- 80% coverage threshold for backend, 75% for frontend
- Separate configurations for unit and integration tests

✅ **Husky for pre-commit hooks**
- Lint-staged for automatic formatting and linting
- Pre-commit: ESLint + Prettier
- Commit-msg: Conventional commits validation

✅ **Conventional commits enforcement**
- Commitlint configuration with standard types
- Automated changelog generation support
- 100-character header limit

### 3. Security Standards (Enterprise-Grade)
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Defined roles: super_admin, admin, manager, staff, readonly
- Permission-based access control with resource:action format
- Session management with limits and validation

✅ **AES-256 encryption standards**
- Key derivation using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Quarterly key rotation policy
- Comprehensive data classification and encryption policies

✅ **Winston for audit logging**
- Structured JSON logging with multiple transports
- Audit trail for authentication, authorization, data access
- Log rotation and retention policies

✅ **Rate limiting with Express-rate-limit**
- Global and endpoint-specific rate limits
- User-based and role-based limiting
- IP whitelisting and custom limits

✅ **Security headers configuration**
- Helmet.js integration with CSP
- HSTS, XSS protection, CSRF prevention
- Custom security headers for enterprise compliance

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline (Automated Workflow)
✅ **GitHub Actions workflow**
- Multi-stage pipeline: Setup → Quality → Testing → Security → Build
- Parallel execution for efficiency
- Node.js 18.x with matrix testing support

✅ **Automated testing on PR**
- Unit tests for both backend and frontend
- Integration tests with PostgreSQL service
- End-to-end testing setup

✅ **Code quality gates**
- ESLint and Prettier checks
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- 80% code coverage requirement

✅ **Automated security scanning**
- CodeQL for SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Secret scanning with TruffleHog

✅ **Environment-specific deployment configs**
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback capabilities

### 5. Documentation (Complete Coverage)
✅ **OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation**
- OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
- Comprehensive schemas and error responses
- Authentication and security schemes
- Server configuration for multiple environments

✅ **JSDoc for code documentation**
- Required documentation tags for functions and classes
- TypeDoc integration for generated documentation
- Example code requirements

✅ **README.md templates**
- Structured sections with badges
- Installation, usage, and development guides
- Security and contributing guidelines

✅ **Contributing guidelines**
- Code of conduct reference
- Development workflow and standards
- Pull request requirements and templates

✅ **Security policy**
- Vulnerability reporting process
- Response timelines and procedures
- Incident response and escalation
